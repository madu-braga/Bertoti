## :books: Introduction
When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, their use becomes easy and intuitive. There are some rules that must be followed, as we will discuss later and can be found in WCAG/W3C. However, as we will see, not all sites follow this rule, causing discomfort to the user and rendering the system unusable.

## 1. Principle – Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
