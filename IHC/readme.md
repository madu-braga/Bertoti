## :books: Introduction
When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, their use becomes easy and intuitive. There are some rules that must be followed, as we will discuss later and can be found in WCAG/W3C. However, as we will see, not all sites follow this rule, causing discomfort to the user and rendering the system unusable.

## 1. Principle ‚Äì Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
 ### 1.1 ‚Äì Text Alternatives
 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
 ### 1.1.1 Non-text Content, Level A
  Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

  >The Anime Online is an example of this heuristic and google is a counter example
  
<br>

 ### 1.2 ‚Äì Time-based Media
 Provide alternatives for time-based media.
 ### 1.2.4 Captions (Live), Level AA
Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media.
  <br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/826526043917647912/951249982277705748/0ea8acc5-92fd-422a-ae11-6a5560cf988d.png" width="380" height="200"><br>
  >Teams is an example of this heuristic and some social media platforms are a counter example, because they don't have this function

<br>

### 1.3 ‚Äì Adaptable
 Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
 ### 1.3.4 Orientation, Level AA
Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.
  <br><br><img src=".gif" width="660" height="500"><br>
 >Youtube is an example of this heuristic and Drops is a counter example, because they don't have this function

<br>

### 1.4 ‚Äì Distinguishable
 Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
 ### 1.4.1 Use of Color, Level A
Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
  <br><br><img src=".gif" width="660" height="500"><br>
  >Duolingo is an example of this heuristic and siga is a counter example, because they don't have this function

<br>
<br>

## 2. Principle ‚Äì Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.
 ### 2.1 ‚Äì Keyboard Accessible
 Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
 ### 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception), Level AAA
 All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.
  <br><br><img src=".png" width="280" height="380"><br>
  >Google is an example of this heuristic and Teams is a counter example, because they don't have this function
  
<br>

 ### 2.2 ‚Äì Enough Time
 Provide users enough time to read and use content.
 ### 2.2.4 Interruptions, Level AAA
Interruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency.
  <br><br><img src=".png" width="380" height="200"><br>
  >Netflix is an example of this heuristic, because after a time it asks if you want to continue watching

<br>

 ### 2.3 ‚Äì Seizures and Physical Reactions
 Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.
 ### 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions, Level AAA
Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed.
   <br><br><img src=".png" width="280"  height="380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src=".png" width="480" height="300"><br>
  >An example of this heuristic is the salesforce that uses UX concepts, also streaming platforms, for example, Disney+ and Star+ and a counter example is the episode "Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon" - pokemon, that caused countless cases a lot of seizures/physical reactions

<br>

 ### 2.4 ‚Äì Navigable
Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
 ### 2.4.2 Page Titled, Level A
Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.
   <br><br><img src=".png" width="280"  height="380"><br>
  >An example of this heuristic is the trailhead 

<br>

 ### 2.5 ‚Äì Input Modalities
Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.
 ### 2.5.4 Motion Actuation, Level A
Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation
   <br><br><img src=".png" width="280" height="380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src=".png" width="480" height="300"><br>
  >An example of this heuristic is the galaxy watch and the Sansung smartphone is a a counter example, because they don't have this function

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è WCAG Levels
WCAG uses three levels to distinguish the extent of compliance with WCAG 2.1, these levels being A, AA and finally AAA. This is what they represent:

A ‚Äì Lowest level of compliancy.

AA ‚Äì Moderate level of compliancy and the most popular level.

AAA ‚Äì Full compliancy, although not many websites achieve this level as it is sometimes simply not possible to adhere to every single rule with some content.
