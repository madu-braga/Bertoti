## :books: Introduction
When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, their use becomes easy and intuitive. There are some rules that must be followed, as we will discuss later and can be found in WCAG/W3C. However, as we will see, not all sites follow this rule, causing discomfort to the user and rendering the system unusable.

## 1. Principle ‚Äì Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
 ### 1.1 ‚Äì Text Alternatives
 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
 ### 1.1.1 Non-text Content, Level A
  Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

<br>

 ### 1.2 ‚Äì Time-based Media
 Provide alternatives for time-based media.
 ### 1.2.4 Captions (Live), Level AA
Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media.

  >Teams is an example of this heuristic and some social media platforms are a counter example, because they don't have that function

<br>

### 1.3 ‚Äì Adaptable
 Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
 ### 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence, Level A
When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.
  When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

### 1.4 ‚Äì Distinguishable
 Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
 ### 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence, Level A
When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

## ‚öôÔ∏è WCAG Levels
WCAG uses three levels to distinguish the extent of compliance with WCAG 2.1, these levels being A, AA and finally AAA. This is what they represent:

A ‚Äì Lowest level of compliancy.

AA ‚Äì Moderate level of compliancy and the most popular level.

AAA ‚Äì Full compliancy, although not many websites achieve this level as it is sometimes simply not possible to adhere to every single rule with some content.
