## :books: Introduction
When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, their use becomes easy and intuitive. There are some rules that must be followed, as we will discuss later and can be found in WCAG/W3C. However, as we will see, not all sites follow this rule, causing discomfort to the user and rendering the system unusable.

## 1 Principle Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
 ### 1.1.1 Non-text Content, Level A
  Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

 ### 1.3.4 Orientation, Level AA
Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

<br>

 ### 2.3 ‚Äì Seizures and Physical Reactions

 ### 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions, Level AAA
Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed.

  >An example of this heuristic is the salesforce that uses UX concepts, also streaming platforms, for example, Disney+ and Star+ and a counter example is the episode "Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon" - pokemon, that caused countless cases a lot of seizures/physical reactions

<br>

 ### 2.4 ‚Äì Navigable

## 4 Principle Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
 ###  4.1 ‚Äì Compatible
Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

  >Trailhead is an example of this heuristic
  
<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è WCAG Levels
WCAG uses three levels to distinguish the extent of compliance with WCAG 2.1, these levels being A, AA and finally AAA. This is what they represent:

A ‚Äì Lowest level of compliancy.

AA ‚Äì Moderate level of compliancy and the most popular level.

AAA ‚Äì Full compliancy, although not many websites achieve this level as it is sometimes simply not possible to adhere to every single rule with some content.
